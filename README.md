- 👋 Hi, I’m @derrickb42
- 👀 I’m interested in the ability to combine art, science, technology, the humanities and imagination remains an enduring recipe for creativity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Arduino-compatible microcontrollers that are simple computers designed to be embedded with practical programming and Raspberry Pi IOT devices. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on practical coding and references on how I can get GitHub going. Would like some guidance. Thanks.
- 📫 How to reach me? I can be reached by email derrickb042@gmail.com or derrickb42@proton.me
